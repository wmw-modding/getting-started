## What you need

* Where's My Water apk

* [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/)

* [APK Editor Studio](https://github.com/kefir500/apk-editor-studio)

* [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

* [apksigner](https://developer.android.com/studio) (unfortunately, you need to install android studio to get it).


### Getting the apk

1. Install the apk

    You need to first install it on an android device (could be an emulator). You can get it on [google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.WMW) for $1.99.
    
    You can also find it online if you can't buy it. This doesn't need to be installed, but it is a good idea to install it to make sure it works. BE CAREFUL WHEN DOWNLOADING APPS ONLINE!!

2. if you downloaded the apk online, then you can skip this step. This is only for getting an installed apk.

    You need to get an android file manager to get the apk. A file manager I recommend is [File Manager +](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphainventor.filemanager). If you know how to do this another way, go ahead.

    Open the file manager and head over to the apps section

    Once you're there, find "Water?", then tap and hold it to select the app

    Once you've done that, all you need to do then is tap share, File Manager +, then select a detination folder.

    The filename will most likely be called `base.apk`, so you can go ahead and rename to make it easier to know what it is.

3. Copy it onto your computer

    To copy it to your computer, there are many different ways, but here's the way I recommend.

    Plug your device into your computer, then go into the new drive, and find your apk. You might have to enable USB Debugging (you can find that in developer settings). Once you've found the apk, you can copy it directly to your computer.

    You can do this though a cloud service, but I recommend doing it over USB as you'd be copying the apk to your device whenever you want to test the mod, which you do quite a lot.

    If you're on an emulator, then there's probobly some way to copy files to your pc without a cord.
